# NC DMV Appointment Scheduler
Unofficial Program. Personal Use Only. 
 
## Description
This is a web application that replaces users for finding and scheduling NC DMV appointments with users' personal information, and time and location preferences.

### Problem
When people need to schedule appointments as soon as possible, for example, in two weeks, but there are only a few spots open which, however, are not their preferred time. Realizing that some people would cancel or reschedule appointments right before their appointments, they tend to spend a lot of time on refreshing pages to see if there are new open spots. This process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and tedious.

### Solution
To build a program that helps users:
* Click on buttons on the website to go back and forth,
* Check if there are open spots with users' preferred location and time,
* Enter personal information and finish the registration,
* Refresh pages and repeat the process again if no open spots.

### Target Users
People who will need to schedule an NC DMV appointment as soon as possible.
